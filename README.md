# ZDSearch

A 

Transient notes: 

* The app will not assert that the data is linked correctly, as the test data includes tickets which declare organisations that are not present.
* The domain objects have fields matching the JSON field names, and default values to ease parsing.

Todos:
* need to be able to search for empty
* need to print human-readable
* need to print related objects (as per screenshots, maybe just a portion?)
* note that partial words are supported
